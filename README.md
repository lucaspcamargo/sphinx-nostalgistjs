# sphinx-nostalgistjs

Sphinx extension for embedding RetroArch in HTML documents, using [NostalgistJS](https://nostalgist.js.org/).
Styling and layout depend on Bootstrap v5, not included.

## Demo

Click to start. Use the Z key to jump, and the Enter key to start.
This is emulating "flappybird.nes" on the "FCEUmm" core in RetroArch.

```{nostalgistjs}
    :rom_url: "flappybird.nes"
    :core_id: fceumm
    {
        "omit_attribution": true
    }
```

## Basic Usage

Add this extension to your Sphinx `conf.py`, like so:

``` python
extensions = [
    "sphinx_nostalgistjs",
    â‹¯
]
```

You have to at least configure where to find the JS file to be used whenever a document
uses this extension, also in `conf.py`:

``` python
nostalgistjs_script_url = "https://unpkg.com/nostalgist"
```

In this case, we are using UNPKG as a CDN. You can always download a release of NostalgisJS and place it
in your `_static` folder, loading it like so:

``` python
nostalgistjs_script_url = "/_static/nostalgist.js"
```

If the extension was successfully installed, you can include an emulator in a document, using the following directive:


    ```{nostalgistjs}
        :rom_url: "30yearsofnintendont.bin"
        :core_id: genesis_plus_gx
    ```

This will embed an emulator that loads the given ROM with the respective emulation core.
If `rom_url` is not an URL, and instead, just a plain filename, NostalgistJS will try to load the ROM from [retrobrews](https://retrobrews.github.io/), as of the latest version. This uses the file extesnsion in an attempt to determine the target system automatically. The core is not important in this case.

Please consult the [launch(...) API](https://nostalgist.js.org/apis/launch/) of NostalgistJS to understand these arguments, and the available cores. As for the core to use, as a general rule:

| System     | Core |
|------------|------|
| Mega Drive | genesis_plus_gx |
| NES        | fceumm |
| SNES       | snes9x |
| GB, GBC, GBA | mgba |

## Advanced Usage

It is possible to change most parameters of NostalgistJS using the directive.

Inside the directive, if there is any content, there must be a JSON object that can configure the
emulator in various ways. Most notably, the `'nostalgist_options'` is an object that
can be used to add options to be passed to the [launch(...) API](https://nostalgist.js.org/apis/launch/) of
NostalgistJS.

Here is an example of advanced usage.
This injects preamble JS code to setup input device types and mappings, specific to the ROM being used.
It can get a bit ugly, though:

    ```{nostalgistjs}
        :rom_url: "https://example.site/rom.bin"
        :core_id: genesis_plus_gx
        {
            "nostalgist_options": {
                "retroarchConfig": {
                    "video_smooth": true,
                    "input_auto_mouse_grab": true
                }
            },
            "before_launch_preamble": "let efs = nostalgist.getEmscriptenFS(); efs.mkdirTree('/home/web_user/retroarch/userdata/config/remaps/Genesis Plus GX'); efs.writeFile('/home/web_user/retroarch/userdata/config/remaps/Genesis Plus GX/rom.rmp',  'input_libretro_device_p1 = \"1\"\\ninput_libretro_device_p2 = \"2\"');"
        }
    ```

## TODO 

Create a reference of all possible configuration fields for the directive.

## Troubleshooting

In case the ROM doesn't load, it may be related to CORS configuration issues.
Please refer to the browser's "Developer Tools" console and network tabs for clues of
what may be happening.
